    <h4>Life & Career</h4>
    I am currently an Advisor for few start-ups in Singapore for which I am either a founder of or an Angel Investor in, but I do not hold executive roles at the moment. <br /><br /> With my wife and two kids, we recently transferred from
    Singapore, where we spent the past 12 years, to San Francisco. I plan to use this relocation to add to my arsenal of skills and understanding of the technology world applied to customer needs before jumping back into executive roles.
    <br /><br />I have a track record of successfully raising through the ranks by matching my analytical and business skills to organisations problems and goals. In the last 5 years, I was the CEO of a German Restaurant chain (Brotzeit Pte Ltd)
    which I was instrumental, together with my team, to grow to 20 locations and over $40 million in sales in the Asia Pacific region, leading over 300 employees in the process. <br /><br />I believe my significant leadership experiences, business
    and financial knowledge, paired with the additional UX design and Web Development skills I am seeking to acquire will allow me to more successfully start my own enterprise.

    <H4>Education</H4>
    I hold a Master’s Degree in Economics and Social Sciences from the best Business University in Italy (Bocconi University in Milan). While working in Singapore, I also obtained my CFA® charter from the CFA® Institute,
    a notoriously challenging self-study program in the financial space, despite my large work responsibilities. In other words, I proved over and over that I can achieve what I set my mind to.
